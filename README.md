# Fractalforge
Sources and bin of a Fractal generator for Windows I wrote many years ago

## The Story
I fell in love with fractals when I saw some pictures in an issue of Scientific American in the 80s. When I learned VisualBasic in 1992, I wrote a program to draw them in "true colors" (24bit for pixels) to create some posters using my brand new color inkjet printer.
I kept improving this little program (named UbiMandel at first, then TrueMandel, and finally FractalForge) while my programming skills improved until the last version in 2005.
Meanwhile, I added many features, switched from VB to Delphi, and optimized the algorithm in assembler.

I'd like to port it to Kotlin or another modern language in the future...
For the moment, I'm publishing the source on GitHub for easier discoverability.
